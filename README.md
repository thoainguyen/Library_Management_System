# Library Management System


* After building project via QtCreator, you must copy two files from folder `data` to folder `debug` (maybe `release` due to build mode), which are `database.sqlite` and `noiquy.txt`. Ensure that those files are same directory with `LIBPRO.exe`.

* For trying, you must had an admin account, from it you will grant access role to other :
* Default admin are : thoaikhmt, pass: a
* System has three roles:
  * Admin : Have full right to accessed systems.
  * Librarian : Can accept or denined for borrow book request from users.
  * User : Can borrow and lend book.
